This seed provides the basic components that should be installed on an
PureOS desktop system. It is expected to be supplemented with a
particular flavour of desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

= Hardware and Architecture Support =

== Architecture-independent ==

 * alsa-base        # needed for proper hardware detection (hotplug/blacklist.d, modprobe.d)
 * alsa-utils       # basic audio support and mixer level handling
 * (pcmciautils)    # PCMCIA support for >= 2.6.13-rc1 kernels
 * (inputattach)    # needed for serial mice

Power management:

 * (acpi-support)

Bluetooth:

 * (bluez)       # base for bluetooth support
 * (bluez-obexd)
 * (bluez-cups)  # allow connecting to bluetooth printers from CUPS

Purism:
 * (purism-device-config)

== armel ==

 * apmd [armel]

= Console-Based Tools =

These tools are very commonly used by people who drop into a console shell to do some work.

 * bc
 * zip
 * unzip                # also used for .zip support in file-roller
 * libpam-systemd
 * (genisoimage)

= Network Services =

Basic network services and Windows integration.

 * wireless-tools
 * rfkill              # No longer using the copy from wireless-tools (LP: #715309)
 * (libnss-mdns)       # IPv4 link-local DNS support
 * ca-certificates     # common SSL certificates

These packages help with system integration

 * libsasl2-modules    # allows integration with MTA and login system
 * (avahi-daemon)      # some people do not like it, and it is not essential

= Printing =

Printing and printer configuration is a real weak spot in Debian, and in Linux in general. We will need to stay at the front of the curve here.

 * (cups)                     # our preferred printer management infrastructure
 * (cups-bsd)                 # gives us lpc, lpq, lpr, lprm
 * (cups-client)              # gives us cancel, cupstestppd, lp, lpoptions, lppasswd, lpstat, cupsaddsmb, accept, lpadmin, lpinfo, lpmove
 * foomatic-db-compressed-ppds  # the foomatic printer driver database
 * foomatic-filters             # converter from postscript to printer-specific formats
 * openprinting-ppds            # Most common drivers we want in desktop; less common are in o-p-extra
 * ghostscript-x
 * (hplip)     			# support for HP all-in-one printers
 * (printer-driver-pnm2ppa)     # several ppds require this
 * (printer-driver-min12xxw)	# support for KonicaMinolta PagePro 1200W, 1300W printers
 * (printer-driver-foo2zjs)	# support for printing to ZjStream-based printers
 * (printer-driver-splix)	# support for Samsung lasers
 * (printer-driver-pxljr)	# support for HP Color lasers
 * (printer-driver-c2esp)       # support for Kodak injket printers
 * (printer-driver-ptouch)      # support for Brother P-touch printers
 * (printer-driver-sag-gdi)     # support for Rico Aficio SPxxxx printers

= GUI infrastructure =

Packages used for X preconfiguration are just Recommends; removing them after initial installation should be relatively safe.

 * (laptop-detect)

 * xorg                          # this includes xserver-xorg->xserver-xorg-{input|video}-* (no need to add specific drivers manually)
 * !linux-image-*                # xorg transitively depends on this, but this would pull in grub-pc; we handle that separately
 * xkb-data                      # XKB data now lives here

 * (xdg-utils)                   # useful utilities
 * xdg-user-dirs
 * libnotify-bin                 # various scripts need notify-send (such as .bashrc's "alert")

 * (pulseaudio)
 * (pulseaudio-module-bluetooth)
 * (packagekit)

Fonts:

 * fonts-dejavu-core
 * fonts-noto-hinted
 * (fonts-hack-ttf)
 * (fonts-noto-cjk)
 * (fonts-linuxlibertine)
 * (fonts-arkpandora)

Media codecs:

 * (libavcodec-extra)

 * (gstreamer1.0-plugins-good)
 * (gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad)
 * (gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly)
 * (gstreamer1.0-fluendo-mp3)

= Other =

 * anacron      # generally appropriate for desktops
 * (cryptsetup) # needed for encrypted devices, also in d-i-requirements seed but might be needed for 3rd party drives
 * (policykit-desktop-privileges) # passwordless disk/CPU speed/time operations for admins

= Boot =

 * (grub-theme-pureos)

= Meta =

 * pureos-standard # the standard PureOS system
